# SilverAudioPlayer  
A *simple* (well a lot simpler then audioplayerz) audio player that has the worst code quality known to (hu)man and buggy as hell (much).  
Aims to run on everything from windows 7 to windows 10, fails at that, is commonly tested on windows 10 and windows 7 but everything in between has not been tested so please do test if possible.  
Aims to be modular and ill only give it that because it does not succeed at it
# Q&A:
- Why so many empty projects with the names of ui frameworks?
  - I plan on eventually making a implementation of SilverAudioPlayer on most of those ui frameworks with the goal of allowing choice.
- Why is the code so bad?
  - Good question, I am not sure if I am going to fix it or not.
- Why use dotnet?
  - I have no experience with any other frameworks/languages except some basic c/c++
- Why not use java?
  - Look at the previous answer
- Why not use python?
  - I don't want a snake in my computer

- Why?
  - Why not?
- Why not use electron?
  - Do you really want all your ram to be used by glorified web browsers just so i can slack off?
- Why not use react native?
  - Do you really trust facebook in ui design (+ I have no experience with it)
- Where do I report bugs?
  - Here on github, or anywhere else you can find me on social media
- Do you plan to add support for x platform/ui framework/file format?
  - Maybe, well it all depends. I WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY KIND OF SUPPORT TO ANY PLATFORM MADE BY APPLE INC. (I don't plan on supporting a stupid company) You may contribute support for any platform/ui framework/file format and those contributions will most likely be accepted and gladly appreciated.
