# SilverAudioPlayer  
A *simple* (well a lot simpler then audioplayerz) audio player that has the worst code quality known to (hu)man and buggy as hell (much).  
Aims to run on everything from windows 7 to windows 10, fails at that, is commonly tested on windows 10 and windows 7 but everything in between has not been tested so please do test if possible.  
Aims to be modular and ill only give it that because it does not succeed at it
