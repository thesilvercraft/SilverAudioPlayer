# SilverAudioPlayer  
A *simple* (well a lot simpler then audioplayerz) audio player.  
Aims to run on everything from windows 7 to windows 10, fails at that, is commonly tested on windows 10 and windows 7 but everything in between has not been tested so please do test if possible.  
Aims to be modular and I'll only give it that because it does not succeed at it, it does use the Managed Extensibility Framework (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/mef/) and has some intefraces you can implement to add support for other wave(pcm) like file formats or you could implement a different player entirely (the possibility is basically endless as long as you can do it in c# or at least from c# you could probably play the file)
